# Zelda Breath of the Wild - Armor Tracker

Welcome to the BOTW Armor Tracker

This web site is created using Angular and is designed to help you track which armors you have already collected, 
the current level of each of them and the necessary items to fully upgrade it.
You also can change to display the material by upgrade level.

On each card you will find a armor. To change the level, first mark it as obtained. 
After that you will be able to use the stars to change the level of your armor and select the current level of your armor. 
By changing the level the list of materials below the armor will be updated, indicating the remaining items to fully upgrade the armor.

On the left, you can find a list of all the materials needed to fully upgrade every armor you marked as obtained.

The web site will save locally your modifications, so if you use it again you can resume your work.
